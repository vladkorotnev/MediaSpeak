This is a mobile substrate tweak that speaks the current playing song by saying "Now Playing: SONG_NAME By ARTIST_NAME".

I don't know what license this falls under, but I'll give it my best shot to clarify.

You can NOT steal and use code, but if you plan to release something competing, just give me a heads up majdfhailylebanon[at]gmail.com and we'll discuss that possibility.
